# Social Gaming MCP: Meet New People Through Games

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that turns Puch AI (a WhatsApp-based assistant) into your personal gaming matchmaker. The main motivation is to help you meet and connect with new people through fun, casual online games â€“ no apps or websites needed, just chat with the AI!

## How It Works
- **Quick Matchmaking**: Message the AI to join queues for games like Skribbl.io (drawing/guessing) or Death by AI (survival challenges).
- **Private Lobbies**: Create shareable game rooms that auto-expire (default: 30 min).
- **Real-Time Updates**: Get notifications on who's joining and when the game starts.
- **Lobby Chat**: Talk with potential new friends while waiting.
